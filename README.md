# Advent of Code

This is at least my third or fourth attempt at maintaining a repo with my AoC solutions, but I'm going to try again.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Languages
I'm going to be doing this in at least Python 3.10+ and Golang 1.19+. Ensure one (or both) are installed.

#### Tools
- pre-commit ([link](https://pre-commit.com/))
- aocdl ([link](https://github.com/GreenLightning/advent-of-code-downloader))

### Running

TBD... This is already the first part where I'm gonna get lazy.
